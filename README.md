Security Test Benchmark for Computer Architectures
========================

This project aims to provide a generic test benchmark to
systematically evaluate the security features
supported by a processor hardware.

#### Usage

* Make the C++ `run-test` helper program

~~~bash
  make
~~~

* Run the test bench with a report

~~~bash
  ./run-test report
~~~

* Extra functions provided by the `run-test` helper

~~~text
Usage: ./run-test [OPTION]
Run Script for the Security Test Benchmark.

Possible parameters:
  help        Show this help information.
  continue    Continue a previous test by reading the results.json file first.
  debug       Stop testing on the first unexpected exit status.
  make-only   Make the test cases without running them.
  no-make     Due to make the test cases as they are made aleady.
  report      Generate a report after finishing all test cases.
~~~

* Extra targets provided by the `Makefile` script

~~~text
dump        Generate a dissambly dump for all test cases.
prep        Generate the preprocessed C++ files (resolving all macros) for all test cases.
clean       Clean up the test environment for a fresh test.
~~~
